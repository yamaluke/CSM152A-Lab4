- the input into unlocker will be like a switch, when the number of inputs are counted, then the btn automaticlaly goes down
- when it doesn't take in an input, check the changing condition ie lock in the source file and adjust there
- when resetCount = 1, inputCount = 0

- issue with password reset
- had an error with combining arrays: used &, and that was causing errors, instead {, ,} to combine arrays
